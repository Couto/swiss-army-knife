# Swiss-Army Knife

---

Over the years, I've collected some scripts, that once in a while come to be
handy for certain tasks.

This library is just a way of collecting those scripts in the same place,
instead of ad-hoc gists.

**Disclaimer**: These scripts were made for personal use and to solve specific 
problems that arouse during some projects. You're free to use them, but don't 
expect them to be high-quality, full-proof scripts.

The advantage of these scripts, is that they are simple, and very very
_copy-pasteable_.

If you're looking for high-quality code, there are better libraries in the wild
like:

	* [lodash](https://lodash.com/)
	* [ramda](http://ramdajs.com/)
	* [sanctuary](https://sanctuary.js.org/)
	* [bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com/)
